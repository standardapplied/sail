# Changelog

## Unreleased

No unreleased changes.

## 0.17.2

- Spec listings now expose `last_activity_at` so clients can order rooms by recent activity.
- Automatic setup triggers now share one best-effort reconciliation policy.

## 0.17.1

- `sail up` now reconciles the container's Sail-managed surface on every start.

## 0.17.0

- In-container interactive sessions now receive ambient box credentials tied to the FDE identity.

## 0.16.0

- Every run now acts as an attributable agent principal with a run-scoped credential.
- The server resolves agent credentials to principals and records those identities on events,
  specs, change history, and run listings.
- Agent principals are member-tier and cannot use dispatch or stop lanes.
- Every run-finishing path revokes its credential, with an expiry sweep for stragglers.
- Stop verification now kills the whole cgroup and polls for confirmed termination.
- Specs now support conversation messages.

## 0.15.0

Version 0.15.0 is the v1 upgrade floor. Upgrade every box in a fleet to 0.15.0 before
installing a later v1 release.

- The pre-v1 migration chain is collapsed into a guarded schema baseline; sync refuses a peer
  below 0.15.0 before exchanging data.
- Every agent session is now a first-class run with one whole-container reservation model. Stop any
  running agent session before upgrading: the fixed `sail-agent` unit is gone, and a session
  launched by an older binary is invisible to this version's stop, status, and log commands.
- Ad-hoc, dispatch, and review sessions share run-scoped units, logs, process identity, stop,
  status, watcher recovery, and reconciliation behavior.
- Process start-time fingerprints prevent stale runs from signaling a reused PID.
- Review runs record their real execution identity.

## 0.14.0

Version 0.14.0 establishes the schema floor carried forward by the v1 baseline.

- Legacy runs, specs, projects, and reviews are carried to the current data shape by `sail
  migrate`.
- Legacy build runs without a run-scoped unit are stopped; foreground review runs are unchanged.
- Synced entities receive content-addressed baseline revisions once.
- API tokens owned by an FDE now cascade when that FDE is removed.
